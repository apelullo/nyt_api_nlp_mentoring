b. Companies regularly sell data to other companies without people's full, knowing  consent. This is where I tell patients to read the fine print when using websites or services like 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe, etc.

HIPAA actually permits sharing for research and other purposes, and you don't necessarily have to spend a lot of money to de-identify the data in order to acquire it for a genuine research purpose.  But HIPAA does leave the decision about whether to share information for research in the hands of the covered entity who maintains that information -- and therein lies the problem.  
If it's not in their interest to share that data with you, it doesn't matter how worthwhile your project is.  So a conservative interpretation of HIPAA often masks the real excuse, which is more likely to be one (or more) of the following: not a priority for the data holder; data holder has concerns about what you'll actually do with the data (i.e., will you use it to competitive advantage); data is perceived to be a corporate asset (therefore rarely made available outside of the institution).

Thought I should add that my privacy concern is with profit-making entities and not the non-profits.  And Mr. Miner is likely making the correct point that big data is needed to feed those learning algorithms designed to make our lives truly better.  

This is another area, by the way, that China's AI has a leg up due to their vast population data (maybe using our phones too).  Whichever country that pulls ahead first with AI rules the future.  (Moreover, their command economy is very well suited to AI).

A-student researchers have deep knowledge in a narrow domain.  They are purists unsullied by concern for profit.  The B-students, whom they work for, focus on that.  The naivety of the researcher locked into his lab is understandable.  They make the breakthroughs but the money guys own and fund their research.  

Profit, not data, is the root of evil.  You don't need it (as they say you do) to make a corporation viable.  Profit is excess, all expenses including reinvestment and salaries have already been paid.  Profit is rent to risk investors and a cushion for a rainy day.  But you don't need it; non-profits work fine without the premium and are not pushed to monetize everything at all costs.

I'd have no problem with non-profit research groups using big data to fulfill their mission.  They have no inherent motivation to get greedy.  It's only the profit-at-any-cost corporations that we need to protect against.

In practice, no one wishing to share their data would upload it.  Rather, anyone wanting to see a physician, or wishing to be covered by health insurance would be asked to sign paperwork akin to the ""terms and conditions"" many of us routinely sign to use apps and websites.

What this means is that patients would lose control over their data, likely in a way that would be irreversible.  As health care providers are also increasingly asked to document lifestyle issues that may relate to health, like sexual orientation and practices, immigration status, legal history, firearm ownership, history of physical or sexual abuse, or job or marital conflicts that cause stress or insomnia, this information is likely to end up being shared in perpetuity with health care organizations.

What I actually found running such programming on real-world problems was that AI, like computers, is basically a slide rule writ large.

My friend was actually doing similar work on a health insurance company's data on several million customers. But it ain't magic, it's math, big, fast math.

Stair climbing doesn't tally to my calorie output, but an insurance company would assume I am in the healthy habit of taking the stairs.

It's worth remembering that before the advent of AI, the primary reason for poorly functioning insurance markets was that consumers had more information than insurance companies. For for every reckless driver or carrier of a genetic disease that receives a lower insurance price in the absence of AI, there is a good driver or genetically healthier consumer who receives a higher price and pays more than his/her expected costs. AI makes some people better off and others worse off.

I completely agree that we as a society should pool risks, and the idea that individuals with certain genetic histories should pay more to insure large healthcare expenses is indeed repugnant. People who are lucky enough not to be born with genetic diseases should support the people who aren't so lucky.

With declining payers, the costs of running the industry increase dramatically -- sure they won't be paying out as much, but the industry is assuming that those that are good risks will continue to purchase (and that's not a sure thing).  When folks are denied a product demand declines -- and as demand withers, so will supply.  There will likely still be a market for those that are low risk, but that market is puny compared the size of the current market.  This is just another example on how AI/automation is decimating the labour market -- perhaps the guaranteed income supplement starts to look more realistic.",1555302741,1555337432,1555302743,5,0,False,,,1,comment,0,0,100009118,False,1

There is a difference between universal healthcare and universal health insurance.  Insurance is used to make sure that big medicine gets paid, not to ensure that everyone has access to medical care.

In 2010, Americans spent 18% of GDP on healthcare, between individuals, employers and government programs.  By 2017 [before Republicans had the opportunity to change anything] it was up to 20% of a bigger GDP.  Americans did not get extra healthcare services.  

Hospitals serving large proportions of Medicaid patients closed when democrats stripped funding for them in order to provide free health insurance to able bodied childless adults.  Democrats also stripped funding for SCHIP that was allowing middle class parents of sick or injured children from being impoverished.

People with Obamacare policies and Medicaid now have provider networks that completely exclude all centers of excellence.

The most vulnerable got less.  Charity hospitals serving the wealthy got concierge services, aroma therapy and grandiose marble lobbies and waiting rooms.  The ER no longer had the hoi poloi clogging them because they were relegated to the providers for the poor. Executive directors got pay raises.

Quite rationally, insurance companies want to calibrate each policy-holder's risk so as to distribute the anticipated costs. The only problem, however, is that doing so eliminates insurance's risk-distribution function. The more accurately an individual's risk can be measured and charged, the less reason such an individual has to buy insurance.

Consider the limit case: if the insurance company can precisely know an individual's future claims, the premiums it charges will quite reasonably be raised to exactly cover those claims, plus profit, overhead, operations costs, etc.

The individual would thus save money by simply paying the claims... and if they couldn't raise the funds for that, they also won't be able to raise the funds to pay the premiums.

Better knowledge of risk makes (private, for-profit) insurance  less useful or valuable to the consumer.

Note that social insurance like Social Security and Medicare eliminate this by simply including all possible payees and distributing the cost of risk without regard to individual characteristics. The risk is distributed evenly, whatever it is, rather than being allocated to individual insurees.

Obamacare is not insurance.  It is prepaid medical designed to ensure that hospitals and drug companies could raise prices and profits and trick consumers into believing they were getting a good deal because the bulk of the cost was transferred to others.

Insurance is a process where people with similar risk profiles pay similar premiums to protect against large losses.  Auto insurance does not cover oil changes and homeowners insurance does not cover wear and tear.

Obamacare covers contraceptives worth $5/month and allows insurers to charge $50/month because they're ""free"" to the end user.",1555256044,1555256045,1555256045,0,0,False,31528778.0,Pquincy14,2,userReply,0,0,31529231,False,1

I help choose and administrate our group health policy at my employer.

In my experience the insurer doesn't care about long term issues for two reason.  First, the contracts are typically for one year and the employer may jump next year if a better deal comes along.  

Second, most employers, over a few dozen employees, are ""self insured"" even when it looks like a private insurance company.  The insurance company administrates the claims and develops a network of discounts.  Weekly, the employer pays all the claims (minus deductibles and co-pays) up to a large number each year.  Our ""attachment point"" is set at $90K for each employee.  After that dollar amount the ""re-insurance"" kicks in.  This is basically a health policy with a $90K deductible on each employee.  About 1% of our staff will likely hit the attachment point each year.   In our plan, the insurance company that is visible to our staff can never pay a claim since the employer pays the first $90K and the re-insurance (a different company completely) picks up after that.  

So the only one who cares about the long term is the employer.",1555021342,1555432475,1555021344,30,0,False,31491578.0,writeon1,2,userReply,0,0,31500179,False,1

You don't want any corporate interference in employees personal lives - and I'm with you 100%.

I'd much rather hand the dollars spent on health insurance directly to the employee.  Then each can choose whatever they want to buy- like every thing else in our lives!!

Employers wouldn't pocket the ""savings"" because they'd still need to compete for talent with all the other employers who now aren't spending on health insurance either.

Their response was that it costs more and more to fix minor damage.  I’m not buying that explanation, because my deductibles for collision and comprehensive were at $2000 at that point.  I think the insurance companies are taking advantage of the fact that so many Americans are in debt on their cars and are forced to buy full coverage by their lenders.  My car is paid off, so I opted to drop collision and comprehensive.  I was a little uncomfortable with this at first, because my 5 year old car is still worth around $12,000, but it was $373 for collision and comprehensive with $2000 deductibles on both.

Your understanding of algorithms is of older ""rule based"" algorithms, which required an explicit encoding of ""rules"" (items to check).

However, newer AI algorithms are based on Machine Learning (ML), which works more similarly to our own brain, which ""modifies"" itself (learns). In ML, the algorithm learns by observation (collecting and looking at all data), just as our brain does. So if it sees ""biased"" data, it learns that bias.

An example is of a Google algorithm that was told to assess ""beauty"" (figure out what types of faces we consider to be beautiful) using images found on the web.  One would estimate that the algorithm would be unbiased, and the Google engineers assumed the web contained all kinds of pictures of people. They then monetized (profited from) their ""research"" by letting other companies, including advertising firms, use their algorithm's results.  They soon were told by those users that their algorithm was racist. Their algorithm only found white thin young women to be beautiful, because (surprise, surprise!) the web contains more images of beautiful white thin young women. This was where the algorithm was not taught about racism, ageism, etc. but it ""became"" biased from the data it found on the web.

Using a Fitbit, say, as part of a health insurance policy, changes the pool, dividing people who follow a certain regimen from those who don't.

Similarly, information gathered by devices that monitor your driving identify you as a member of a distinct pool of drivers based on your driving habits. Those who drive in a way that reduces the chance of a claim will be offered lower rates than those who drive more carelessly. 

I'm not sure I see any real problem with these examples -- they make good sense to me.

Most the areas of concern are low hanging fruit that cost the country dearly. Pregnancies, for example. Fifty percent of the births in this country are covered by Medicaid. Many of that fifty percent is not planned or discovered early on and therefore of that 50% there is a higher percentage of very expensive births than compared to the rest the population.

If we knew they were pregnant earlier perhaps we could start helping earlier? AI can do this.

Zip codes. AI can identify those zip codes and the population within to focus on social determinants of health to link them to resources available locally. It’s not just for discriminating. This is already happening regularly and doesn’t even really need AI.

As the other responders noted, having AI monitor a woman's pregnancy status is horrifying. 

As for the zip code, I already know mine. Who are these entities that need to send me information about the consequences of living in my zip code or where I can go for help? I know the insurance companies still redline to some extent for auto and homeowners' policies.

My city tells me about recreation centers and community health centers, etc., in the water bill. No AI needed to get that information out..

If I'm poor, should I be punished for living where I can afford to live? If I'm rich should I be applauded for living on the right side of the tracks?

Exactly! A few years ago a friend from work, a smoker, was using his debit card to purchase cigarettes -and everything else- from the corner drug store. I told him to only use cash since no doubt, his insurance company would somehow get the data and add it to his profile. His reply was he didn't like carrying cash. Not sure if he's ever had problems with insurance, but that data is sitting there somewhere waiting to pounce. 

I'm amazed (well not really) that so many people give up the right to privacy for so little return. Convenience? It's just not worth it.
