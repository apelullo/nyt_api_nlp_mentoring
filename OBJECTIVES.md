# NYT Mentoring Series: Introduction to API Programming and NLP Topic Modeling
### Course Objectives: *After completing the NYT Mentoring Series, students will be able to*:
#### Part I: API Programming
    * *Define* APIs, why data scientists use them, requests and responses, keys and rate limits, common design patterns and data structures, pagination, nested data, and recursion
    * *Implement a python script invoking the New York Times (NYT) API* that can:
      * Iterate through a list of article URL's, successfully *build and submit a request* for article data at each URL, *receive and parse a JSON response* containing corresponding article data 
      * Build an algorithm to handle switching between multiple keys while tracking and managing rate limits
      * Build an algorithm to parse JSON data, extract paginated comment data and nested comment reply data recursively, and create two separate *master datasets* for article_metadata.csv and comments.csv (comments merged with comment replies)
      * *Link the comments.csv dataset to the article_metadata.csv dataset* via each comment's article_id, and *encode the nested structure of comments and comment replies* with the built-in "parentID" and "depth" API values
#### Part II: NLP Topic Modeling
    * *Define* NLP, structured and unstructured data, transformations and feature engineering for statistical modeling and machine learning, the bag-of-words model for quantifying text, corpus, document, terms, ngrams, term frequency (tf), term frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf), sparse matrices and dimensionality reduction, latent topics and the relationship with terms and documents, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, model train/test/vlidate, k-fold cross validation and hypterparameter optimization, model selection criteria, model output interpretations and further applications, common visualizations that highlight insigts and demonstrate impact (for example, which topics of conversation are popular in the data, how are they associated/correlated/causally-linked with business outcomes, and how did the conversation change in response to business decisions and external stimuli)
    * *Implement a python script using Scikit-learn and common modules* that can:
      * Read the newly created article_metadata.csv and comment.csv files and create dataframes for further processing
      * Build tf and tf-idf document-term matrices with ngrams ranging from 1-3 via Scikit-learn, compare and contrast "top words" according to each metric
      * Initialize and train LDA models for tf and tf-idf matrices via manual hyperparameter selection
      * Initialize and train LDA models for tf and tf-idf matrices via gridsearch hyperparameter selection, select the best model for further analysis and print selection criteria, graphically compare gridsearch results and identify the best model
      * *Build the topic-term and doc-topic matrices*, conduct exploratory analysis to *visualize the underlying topic structure*, identify *salient terms within topics* and *dominant topics within documents*
      * Identify correlations between different topics and between topics and other outcome variables (for example, article recommendations)
#### Part III: Data Storytelling
    * Present findings to peers, mentor, and management committee with *clear focus on hypothetical business impact*, not technical implementation details - which topics are most prevalent in the corpus of articles, which topics drive the most article engagement in the comments, which topics are most correlated with article recommendations, do any topics contain clear buzz-words, etc.
    * *Suggest specific examples* for future applications and experiments - use AI to automatically label topics generated by LDA to improve interpretability and avoid inefficient manual labeling and human bias, use traditional (dictionary-based) and modern (AI) techniques to assess topic sentiment, use topic prevalence/sentiment as variables/features in other experiments and modeling tasks to improve testing/predictions/forecasts/classifications/recommendations/etc. related to business outcomes/KPIs, etc.
